# Antarctic Bases
Project created for university assignment for the Bulgarian Antarctic Institute of Sofia University.
Used electronjs for building the app with mapboxjs for visualisating the map itself, also I made a webscraper for wikipedia table elements to colect data and save it into JSON file with all the needed formatting which then it  populate the map.
